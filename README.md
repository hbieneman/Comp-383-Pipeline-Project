# Comp-383-Pipeline-Project
We are comparing HCMV transcriptomes 2- and 6-days post-infection (dpi). I chose to do track 2 which focuses on genome assembly.

# Track 2:
- Step 2: filter reads with Bowtie2
- Step 3: assemble transcriptomes with SPAdes
- Step 4: analysis the SPAdes assembly
- Step 5: Blast+ analysis

# Dependancies included:
- Bowtie2
- SPAdes
- BLAST+

# Quickly test pipeline using the small sample test data:
- modify the python scripts to use the sample test data
- run the python script
- verify the correct files output
